## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my second Frontend Mentor challenge solution. I designed this using the mobile-first paradigm, with some very simple CSS Flexbox to position the elements on larger screens.

The source files for this project came with 2 images sized slightly differently for desktop and mobile. My solution includes both images in the HTML and changes the `display` property of the image in CSS to show the correct one based on resolution, but if I were to do this again I would probably use something like the `srcset` attribute instead (which I didn't know existed until after I finished!!)
